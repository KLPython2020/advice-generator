## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- [Open-props](https://open-props.style/) - For some styles


### What I learned

One of the things I tackled while coding this project is managing click events. I did a deep dive into the difference between debouncing and throttling.
I ended up using the throttling technique to manage how often will the click event fire.

I also found a quick reference for styling the animation of the button from [Open-props.style](https://open-props.style/) created by [Adam Argyle](https://github.com/argyleink).


### Continued development

There is room for improvement with both my css and javascript, but the goal now is to create this in react.


### Useful resources

- [Throttling vs Debouncing](https://gomakethings.com/debouncing-vs.-throttling-with-vanilla-js/) - This helped me manage the click event of the dice, so there are fewer calls to the api and displaying the data is smoother.
- [Open-props.style](https://open-props.style/) - This was a fast way to do some animation and style the container holding everything for the advice generator.
